## Coding conversions

Start reading my code and you'll get the hang of it. I optimize for readibility:

* I indent using 2 spaces (soft tabs)
* I always put spaces after list items (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), function parameters (`function myFunction(a, b, c) {}` or `myFunction(1, 2, 3)`, not `function myFunction(a,b,c)` or `myFunction(1,2,3)`), operators (`2 == 2`, not `2==2`), and  before and after the keys (except the first one for before) of objects (`{key: "value", a: 1}`, not `{ key: "value", a: 1}` or `{key:"value",a:1}`)
* This is open source software. Consider the people (including me) who read the code and make it look nice for them. It's like driving a car: Perhaps you like your ride to be bumpy, but with other people you got to make the ride as smooth as possible.
